# React + TypeScript + Vite + Jest

This project is for practice to implment a login form.

### Requirements

- Develop a sign-up form.
- Including three fields: username, password, confirm password.

### Specs

- Username: must be valid email address.
- Password: must have at least one capital letter, one numeric character, and one special character.
- Confirm password: must be the same as the password field.
- The user must complete all three fields to submit the form
- When the form is submitted, display a success message and do not need to submit

### Notes

- Front-end code only.
- The front-end should be a single page React app. You may take this opportunity to demonstrate your CSS or HTML knowledge.

### Extra

- Since TDD is mandatory at this company, I want to dedicate additional time to study and apply tests for this project.
